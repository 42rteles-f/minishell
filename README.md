The minishell, as the name suggests, is a project about creating a smaller shell with fewer features. Nonetheless, a big project with a lot of details.<br>
In this project we had a really hands on experience with pipes, processes and shells, we gained a lot of insight as to how bash and shells in general operate. <br>
Contrary to what the name suggests the project is a functional shell, capable of most day-to-day commands.

It's a group project and as such I enjoyed the opportunity to create a git workflow and a scrum organization structure.

Particularly liked the use of function pointers throughout the project, which made for a convenient way of handling the various cases in a single function and changing execution behaviour seamlessly.
